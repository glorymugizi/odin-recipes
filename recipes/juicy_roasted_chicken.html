    <h1 class="sub-heading">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>Â½ cup butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with
        onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken
        cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken.
        Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the
        bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh,
        near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil
        and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
